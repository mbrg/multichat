# API Keys for Development
# These variables are ONLY loaded in development mode as defaults
# They are encrypted and stored in secure storage on first load
# In production, users must enter their keys through the UI for security

# IMPORTANT: For Next.js to expose these to the browser in dev mode,
# they MUST use the NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix. These are ONLY used in development
# and are immediately encrypted in secure storage.
