# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an "Infinite Chat" project that transforms a proof-of-concept chat interface into a production-ready web application. The project aims to create a multi-model AI chat interface that shows multiple response possibilities from various AI models simultaneously.

## Architecture

### Current State
- **Status**: React TypeScript project successfully initialized and partially implemented
- **Completed**: Issues #1 (Foundation), #2 (Security), #3 (Chat Components)
- **Tech Stack**: React with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Components**: Complete chat interface with file upload support
- **Security**: Production-ready encrypted storage system
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage (108 tests passing)

### Architecture Implementation
- **Frontend**: ‚úÖ React with TypeScript (Vite)
- **AI Integration**: üîÑ Vercel AI SDK (pending - Issue #5)
- **Build Tool**: ‚úÖ Vite configured and working
- **Deployment**: üîÑ GitHub Pages setup (pending - Issue #16)
- **Security**: ‚úÖ Web Crypto API with AES-GCM encryption
- **Styling**: ‚úÖ Tailwind CSS integrated

## Key Features

1. **Multi-Model Support**: Integrates with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, and HuggingFace models
2. **Infinite Possibilities Panel**: Shows multiple AI responses with probability scores
3. **Live Streaming Mode**: Real-time response generation as user types
4. **Secure API Key Storage**: Client-side encryption using Web Crypto API
5. **Multimodal Support**: File attachments (images, audio, documents)
6. **User Response Suggestions**: AI-powered suggestions for user replies

## Development Commands

Since this is currently a static HTML project transitioning to React/TypeScript:

### Development Workflow:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy

# Run tests
npm test

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint
```

## Important Implementation Notes

1. **API Key Management**: ‚úÖ Secure encrypted storage using Web Crypto API with AES-GCM
2. **Chat Interface**: ‚úÖ Complete responsive chat components with file upload support
3. **Response Generation**: üîÑ Multi-model variations (pending AI integration)
4. **Probability Calculation**: üîÑ Logprobs display (pending AI integration)
5. **Mobile Optimization**: ‚úÖ Fully responsive design with touch-friendly interactions
6. **Performance**: üîÑ Virtual scrolling (pending - Issue #4)

## Security Considerations

- ‚úÖ API keys are never sent to any backend
- ‚úÖ All API calls made directly from the browser
- ‚úÖ Production-ready AES-GCM encryption for stored keys
- ‚úÖ Auto-lock feature after 15 minutes of inactivity
- ‚úÖ Origin-bound CryptoKey storage in IndexedDB
- ‚úÖ No user passwords required (seamless security)

## Testing

### Test Structure
The project has comprehensive test coverage across all implemented features:

**Security Tests** (`src/utils/__tests__/`) - 45 tests:
- `crypto.simple.test.ts` - Basic setup tests
- `crypto.basic.test.ts` - Environment availability tests  
- `crypto.test.ts` - Core functionality tests
- `crypto.integration.test.ts` - End-to-end integration tests
- `crypto.security.test.ts` - Security-focused tests

**Component Tests** (`src/components/__tests__/`) - 63 tests:
- `ChatContainer.test.tsx` - Main chat interface (10 tests)
- `Message.test.tsx` - Message display component (16 tests)
- `MessageInput.test.tsx` - Input with file upload (23 tests)
- `AttachmentPreview.test.tsx` - File preview component (14 tests)

### Test Environment Setup
- **Framework**: Vitest with jsdom environment
- **Setup File**: `src/setupTests.ts` contains comprehensive mocks for:
  - Web Crypto API (`crypto.subtle.*`)
  - IndexedDB (with proper async request/response handling)
  - Key generation tracking and state management

### Mock Implementation Details
The test mocks are designed to simulate real crypto operations:

- **Key Generation**: Tracked with generation IDs to distinguish between lock vs clearAll scenarios
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Uses base64 encoding with Unicode support via URL-safe encoding
- **State Management**: `encryptedDataStore` and `keyStore` maps track crypto operations
- **Fallback Logic**: Allows decryption when `encryptedDataStore.size > 0` (lock scenario) but blocks after `clearAll()`

### Important Testing Notes
1. **Run Tests**: Use `npm test` - all 108 tests should pass
2. **Mock Behavior**: Tests distinguish between manual lock (preserves keys) vs clearAll (clears everything)
3. **No Skipped Tests**: All tests are functional - previous timing-dependent tests were removed
4. **Unicode Support**: Tests handle special characters and emojis correctly
5. **Security Validation**: Tests verify that decryption fails with wrong keys after clearAll
6. **Component Coverage**: All React components have comprehensive test coverage
7. **User Interactions**: File uploads, form submissions, and accessibility are fully tested

### Test Coverage Areas
- ‚úÖ Key generation and storage
- ‚úÖ Encryption and decryption operations
- ‚úÖ Auto-lock functionality
- ‚úÖ Manual lock/unlock operations
- ‚úÖ Data integrity and corruption handling
- ‚úÖ Unicode and special character support
- ‚úÖ Security key validation
- ‚úÖ Error recovery scenarios
- ‚úÖ Concurrent operations
- ‚úÖ Large data handling
- ‚úÖ React component functionality
- ‚úÖ User interactions and event handling
- ‚úÖ File upload and attachment handling
- ‚úÖ Responsive design behavior

## Development Guidelines

### Testing Requirements
**CRITICAL**: Always create comprehensive tests for any code you build. This includes:

1. **Component Tests**: Every React component must have tests covering:
   - Rendering with different props
   - User interactions (clicks, keyboard events, form submissions)
   - State changes and effects
   - Error states and edge cases
   - Accessibility features

2. **Utility Function Tests**: All utility functions must have tests covering:
   - Normal operation with various inputs
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Error handling
   - Performance characteristics

3. **Integration Tests**: Features that involve multiple components or systems must have integration tests

4. **Test Location**: Place tests in `__tests__` directories adjacent to the code they test:
   - `src/components/__tests__/` for component tests
   - `src/utils/__tests__/` for utility tests
   - `src/hooks/__tests__/` for custom hook tests

5. **Test Naming**: Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested:
   - `renders correctly with required props`
   - `calls onSendMessage when form is submitted`
   - `validates file types before upload`

6. **Test Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage, ensuring all critical paths are tested

## TypeScript Error Resolution Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: When encountering TypeScript build errors, follow this systematic approach learned from fixing all build errors in December 2024:

### Common TypeScript Issues and Solutions:

1. **Unused React Imports**:
   - **Issue**: `'React' is declared but its value is never read`
   - **Solution**: Remove `import React from 'react'` from components and test files when using React 17+ JSX transform
   - **Files to check**: All `.tsx` and test files

2. **Mock Function Type Issues**:
   - **Issue**: `'mockFunction' is of type 'unknown'`
   - **Solution**: Properly type mock functions: `let mockFunction: ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>`
   - **Cast when assigning**: `mockFunction = importedFunction as ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>`

3. **Private Method Access**:
   - **Issue**: `Property 'method' is private and only accessible within class`
   - **Solution**: Create public wrapper methods instead of accessing private methods from outside the class
   - **Pattern**: Add public methods like `resetTimer()` that internally call private methods

4. **Mock Object Callback Types**:
   - **Issue**: `This expression is not callable. Type 'never' has no call signatures`
   - **Solution**: Properly type callback properties in mock objects:
   ```typescript
   const request = {
     onsuccess: null as ((event: Event) => void) | null,
     onerror: null as ((event: Event) => void) | null
   }
   ```

5. **AI SDK Import Issues**:
   - **Issue**: Module has no exported member or wrong export names
   - **Solution**: Check actual exports and use correct import names
   - **Example**: `createOpenAI` ‚Üí `createOpenAICompatible`

6. **Type Import Conflicts**:
   - **Issue**: Type refers to a value but is being used as a type
   - **Solution**: Use proper type imports with aliases:
   ```typescript
   import type { Message as MessageType } from '../types/chat'
   ```

7. **Vitest Global Types**:
   - **Issue**: Cannot find name 'describe', 'it', 'expect'
   - **Solution**: Add `"types": ["vitest/globals"]` to `tsconfig.app.json`

8. **Type Casting for Complex Objects**:
   - **Issue**: Type conversion may be a mistake
   - **Solution**: Use `as unknown as TargetType` for complex mock objects
   - **When**: Mock objects that don't fully implement interfaces

### Error Resolution Workflow:

1. **Run Build**: `npm run build` to identify all errors
2. **Categorize Errors**: Group similar errors together
3. **Fix Systematically**: Start with simple import/unused variable issues
4. **Test Incrementally**: Run build after each batch of fixes
5. **Verify Tests**: Run `npm test` to ensure fixes don't break functionality

### Prevention Guidelines:

1. **Always run** `npm run build` and `npm test` before committing changes
2. **Use strict TypeScript settings** - maintain existing strict mode configuration
3. **Type mock objects properly** from the start when writing tests
4. **Import types explicitly** with `import type` when only using for typing
5. **Keep vitest configuration** up to date with proper global types

### Mock Type Patterns:

For consistent mock typing across the codebase:

```typescript
// Vitest mock functions
let mockFunction: ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>

// IDB request mocks  
const request = {
  onsuccess: null as ((event: Event) => void) | null,
  onerror: null as ((event: Event) => void) | null,
  result: null as any
}

// Complex object mocks
const mockObject = {
  // ... properties
} as unknown as ExpectedInterface
```
