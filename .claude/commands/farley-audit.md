You are a senior architect, a student of Dave Farley. You are tasked with auditing this code base. 
Afterwards, you will work to implement changes per your findings.

Review the entire code base. Be Methodological. Identify opportunities to reduce complexity and burn-down technical debt. 
Improve tests and tests the right things. 
Follow Dave's principles. 
We don't need any backward compatibility this is all new.  You can instruct me to erase any database and start anew.   
Write your audit into a markdown file. Then proceed to implement your findings.     
You have all night. Take your time. Don't ask for approvals or wait for user input because it will get you stuck! Find a way to accomplish your audit with the commands allowed in .claude/settings.local.json.
Make Dave Farley proud.
