## USER-IDENTIFIED ISSUES (FROM todo.md)

### U1. Replace localStorage for API Key Storage in Providers
**File**: `src/services/ai/providers/*.ts` (openai.ts, anthropic.ts, google.ts, mistral.ts, together.ts)
**Issue**: All AI providers use insecure localStorage for API keys instead of the secure storage system
**Priority**: Critical Security Issue
**User Note**: "replace local storage for apikey in providers with actual secret storage"

**Current Implementation**:
```typescript
private async getApiKey(): Promise<string | null> {
  // This will be replaced with secure storage integration
  const apiKey = localStorage.getItem('provider-api-key')
  return apiKey
}
```

**Required Fix**: Integrate with SecureStorage from `src/utils/crypto.ts` which already implements AES-GCM encryption with origin-bound CryptoKey storage in IndexedDB

### U2. Real Probability Calculation from Logprobs
**Files**: All AI provider files implementing `estimateProbability()` method
**Issue**: Using random number generation instead of extracting actual logprobs from model responses
**Priority**: High (Core Feature Accuracy)
**User Note**: "really calculate propabilities from logits dont have mocks (estimateProbability)"

**Current Mock Implementation**:
```typescript
private estimateProbability(temperature: number): number {
  const baseProb = Math.max(0.2, 1.0 - temperature * 0.8)
  const randomFactor = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.3
  return Math.max(0.1, Math.min(0.95, baseProb + randomFactor))
}
```

**Required Fix**: Extract actual logprobs from AI responses and calculate real probabilities. Note that only OpenAI, Mistral, and Together providers support logprobs according to the config.

### U3. Remove Mock Functions from Production Code
**Issue**: Production code contains test/demo mock functions that should not be in production
**Priority**: Medium (Code Quality)
**User Note**: "check for mocks that claude likes across repo"

**Identified Mocks in Production**:
1. `src/hooks/usePossibilities.ts` exports:
   - `createMockResponse()` - Creates fake AI responses
   - `generateVariationsForModel()` - Generates fake response variations
2. `src/components/ChatDemo.tsx` - Entire component generates fake responses
3. `cancelPendingRequests()` in `src/services/ai/index.ts` - Just logs to console

**Required Fix**: Move mock functions to test files or create a separate mock service for demo purposes

### U4. Remove Providers Without Logprob Support
**Issue**: Some AI providers don't support logprobs, making accurate probability calculation impossible
**Priority**: Medium (Feature Consistency)
**User Note**: "remove providers that dont support logits"

**Providers Without Logprob Support** (from config.ts):
- Anthropic (all Claude models): `supportsLogprobs: false`
- Google (all Gemini models): `supportsLogprobs: false`
- OpenAI o1-preview and o1-mini: `supportsLogprobs: false`

**Providers With Logprob Support**:
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o): `supportsLogprobs: true`
- Mistral (all models): `supportsLogprobs: true`
- Together (all models): `supportsLogprobs: true`

**Required Decision**: Either remove non-logprob providers or implement alternative probability scoring

### U5. Verify Test Coverage After Changes
**Issue**: After removing mocks and changing implementations, ensure tests still provide meaningful coverage
**Priority**: High (Quality Assurance)
**User Note**: "check that all tests sitll test somthing"

**Areas Requiring Test Updates**:
1. Provider tests using `estimateProbability()` mock
2. Tests relying on localStorage for API keys
3. Tests using `createMockResponse()` and `generateVariationsForModel()`
4. Integration tests that might break with real API calls

**Required Action**: Run test suite after each change and update tests to maintain coverage

## AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFIED ISSUES

## 1. INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATIONS & MOCKS IN PRODUCTION CODE

### 1.1 Request Cancellation Mock (Partially addresses U3)
**File**: `src/services/ai/index.ts:173-176`
**Issue**: Request cancellation is only a console.log mock
**Priority**: High (User Experience)

**Current Code**:
```typescript
cancelPendingRequests(): void {
  // TODO: Implement request cancellation
  console.log('Cancelling pending requests...')
}
```


### 1.2 Demo Response Generation (Partially addresses U3)
**File**: `src/components/ChatDemo.tsx:10-64`
**Issue**: Uses hardcoded mock responses instead of real AI integration
**Priority**: High (Core Feature)

**Current Implementation**: Generates 50 fake responses with hardcoded text patterns instead of calling actual AI services.

### 1.3 Model Icon Hardcoding
**File**: `src/components/OptionCard.tsx:13-21`
**Issue**: All models show OpenAI logo regardless of actual provider
**Priority**: Low (Visual)

---

## 2. UNINTEGRATED FEATURES FROM TASKS 1-5

### 2.1 Task #4: Possibilities Panel ❌ NOT INTEGRATED
**Status**: Component exists but not properly connected
**Files**: `src/components/PossibilitiesPanel.tsx`, `src/hooks/usePossibilities.ts`
**Issue**: The real AI service is not connected to generate actual possibilities

**Missing Integration**:
- Connect `usePossibilities` hook to `AIService.generateMultiModelResponses()`
- Replace mock response generation in ChatDemo with real AI calls
- Implement proper loading states during AI generation

### 2.2 Task #5: Vercel AI SDK ⚠️ PARTIALLY INTEGRATED
**Status**: SDK imported and basic structure exists, but incomplete
**Files**: `src/services/ai/providers/*.ts`
**Issues**:
- API keys not properly secured (using localStorage) - See U1
- Logprobs not properly extracted from responses - See U2
- Error handling incomplete
- No request cancellation implementation - See U3/1.1

### 2.3 Task #6: Multi-Response Generation ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Status**: Core logic exists but not integrated with UI
**Files**: `src/services/ai/index.ts`
**Missing**: Connection between `generateMultiModelResponses()` and the UI components

### 2.4 Task #2: Secure Storage ⚠️ IMPLEMENTED BUT NOT USED
**Status**: Complete implementation exists but AI providers bypass it
**Files**: `src/utils/crypto.ts`, `src/hooks/useApiKeys.ts`
**Issue**: AI providers directly access localStorage instead of using SecureStorage - See U1

---

## 3. BUGS AND ISSUES

### 3.1 Security Vulnerabilities
1. **API Key Exposure**: All AI providers store keys in plain localStorage - See U1
2. **Inconsistent Storage**: useApiKeys uses SecureStorage but providers use localStorage - See U1
3. **Missing API Key Validation**: Settings component saves keys without validation

### 3.2 Functional Bugs
1. **Broken Integration**: Real AI service not connected to chat interface - See U3/1.2
2. **Invalid Mock Data**: usePossibilities creates logprobs incorrectly - See U2/U3
3. **Missing Error Boundaries**: No React error boundaries for AI failures
4. **Inconsistent State**: Multiple sources of truth for API keys - See U1

### 3.3 UI/UX Issues
1. **Generic Icons**: All models show OpenAI logo
2. **No Loading States**: Missing loading indicators during AI generation
3. **No Error Messages**: Users won't see helpful error messages for API failures

---

## 4. COMPLEXITY REDUCTION OPPORTUNITIES

### 4.1 Duplicate State Management
**Issue**: API keys stored in both SecureStorage and localStorage - See U1
**Solution**: Use only SecureStorage throughout the application

### 4.2 Mock Functions in Production
**File**: `src/hooks/usePossibilities.ts`
**Issue**: Contains `createMockResponse()` and `generateVariationsForModel()` that should be test-only - See U3
**Solution**: Move mocks to test files, create real integration hooks

### 4.3 Hardcoded Provider Configuration
**Issue**: Provider-specific logic scattered across multiple files
**Solution**: Centralize provider configuration and create a provider factory

### 4.4 Complex Message Interface
**File**: `src/types/chat.ts`
**Issue**: Message type has overlapping concerns (chat vs AI response)
**Solution**: Separate ChatMessage from AIResponse types

### 4.5 Monolithic ChatDemo Component
**File**: `src/components/ChatDemo.tsx`
**Issue**: Handles both demo logic and real chat functionality
**Solution**: Split into DemoContainer and ChatApp components
