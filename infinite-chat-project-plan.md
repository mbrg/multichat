# Infinite Chat - Engineering Project Plan

## Project Overview
Transform the Infinite Possibilities Chat POC into a production-ready web application hosted on GitHub Pages, using the Vercel AI SDK for model interactions and implementing secure client-side API key management.

## Parallelization Strategy
Issues are organized by dependencies to maximize parallel development:
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Some issues must be completed before others can start
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple issues can be worked on simultaneously by different team members
- **Independent Work Streams**: UI, Security, and AI integration can largely proceed in parallel

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **AI Integration**: Vercel AI SDK
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions
- **Security**: Web Crypto API for client-side encryption
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Static Site Generation**: Pure client-side application for GitHub Pages compatibility
2. **Secure Key Storage**: Encrypted localStorage using Web Crypto API
3. **Probability Calculation**: Use logprobs from AI responses to show actual probabilities
4. **No Backend Required**: All API calls made directly from browser

## Development Phases with Parallelization

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
**Can be done in parallel after Issue #1 completes**

### Issue #1: Initialize React TypeScript Project with Vite
**Priority**: P0  
**Estimated**: 2 hours  
**Assignee**: Frontend Engineer  
**Dependencies**: None - **BLOCKS ALL OTHER ISSUES**

**Description**:
Set up the base project structure for a React TypeScript application optimized for GitHub Pages deployment.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Initialize Vite project with React TypeScript template
- [ ] Configure for GitHub Pages deployment (base path, etc.)
- [ ] Set up ESLint and Prettier
- [ ] Configure TypeScript for strict mode
- [ ] Add Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Create basic folder structure:
  ```
  src/
    components/
    hooks/
    utils/
    types/
    stores/
    styles/
  ```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Project builds and runs locally
- GitHub Actions workflow for deployment to GitHub Pages
- All linting passes

Below is a drop-in replacement for the current **Issue #2** section, preserving the same markdown structure and headings while reflecting the streamlined, pass-phrase-free design we discussed.

### Issue #2: Implement Secure API-Key Storage via Origin-Bound CryptoKey

**Priority**: P0
**Estimated**: 4 hours
**Assignee**: Security-focused Engineer  
**Dependencies**: Issue #1 - **CAN RUN IN PARALLEL WITH ISSUES #3-6**

**Description**:
Implement a lightweight, browser-native system that encrypts API keys with an **origin-bound `CryptoKey`** persisted in IndexedDB—no user pass-phrase, no extra UI friction.

**Tasks**:

* [ ] Generate and persist a non-extractable 256-bit AES-GCM `CryptoKey` in IndexedDB on first run.
* [ ] Build `SecureStorage` utility with methods:

  * `encryptAndStore(key: string, value: string)`
  * `decryptAndRetrieve(key: string)`
  * `clearAll()`
* [ ] Hold the `CryptoKey` in memory after retrieval and **purge it after 15 min of inactivity** or on tab close.
* [ ] Enforce a strict **Content-Security-Policy** (no inline scripts) and enable `trustedTypes` to mitigate XSS.
* [ ] Write unit tests covering encryption, decryption, idle auto-lock, and CSP enforcement.&#x20;

**Code Structure**:

```typescript
// src/utils/crypto.ts
export class SecureStorage {
  // Persisted CryptoKey promise; resolves once per session
  private static keyPromise: Promise<CryptoKey>;

  // Idle timer handle for auto-lock
  private static idleTimer: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null = null;

  private static async getKey(): Promise<CryptoKey> { /* … */ }

  public static async encrypt(data: string): Promise<string> { /* … */ }

  public static async decrypt(ciphertext: string): Promise<string> { /* … */ }

  public static clearAll(): void { /* purge IndexedDB & memory */ }
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:

* API keys are **never** stored in plain text.
* Keys are encrypted/decrypted with AES-GCM using the origin-bound `CryptoKey`.
* No pass-phrase is ever requested from the user.
* In-memory key is flushed after 15 minutes of inactivity.
* Strict CSP and `trustedTypes` are active site-wide.
* All unit tests pass.
