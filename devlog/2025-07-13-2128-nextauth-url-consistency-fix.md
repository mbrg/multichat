# 2025-07-13 21:28 - NextAuth URL Consistency Fix

## Issue Details
**Issue Title**: Use NEXTAUTH_URL consistently for all metadata URL generation
**Issue Description**: Social media previews and metadata URLs were inconsistently using hardcoded values instead of the NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable, causing issues in different deployment environments
**Dependencies**: NextAuth configuration, dynamic metadata generation
**Started**: 2025-07-13 20:00
**Completed**: 2025-07-13 21:28

## Summary
Fixed inconsistent URL generation across social media previews and metadata by standardizing on NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable usage, and improved social media title formatting.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `app/conversation/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated dynamic metadata generation to use NEXTAUTH_URL consistently
- `app/metadata.ts` - Fixed base URL configuration to use NEXTAUTH_URL instead of hardcoded values
- `devlog/2025-07-13-dynamic-social-media-previews.md` - Updated documentation to reflect URL consistency changes

### Architecture Decisions

### Design Choices
Used NEXTAUTH_URL as the single source of truth for all URL generation to ensure consistency across development, staging, and production environments.

### Trade-offs
Relying on environment variable configuration requires proper setup but provides better deployment flexibility than hardcoded values.

### Patterns Used
Environment-based configuration pattern for URL generation across the application.

## Implementation Notes

### Key Algorithms/Logic
- Centralized URL generation using NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable
- Dynamic metadata generation for conversation sharing with proper base URLs
- Social media title formatting improvements using "Prompt:" prefix instead of "User:"

### External Dependencies
- NextAuth.js for URL configuration
- Next.js dynamic metadata API

### Performance Considerations
No performance impact - purely configuration and formatting changes.

## Testing Strategy
Manual testing of social media previews and metadata generation across different environments to ensure URLs resolve correctly.

## Known Issues/Future Work
None identified - this resolves the URL consistency issues.

## Integration Points
- NextAuth.js authentication system
- Dynamic social media preview generation
- Conversation sharing functionality

## Deployment/Configuration Changes
Requires NEXTAUTH_URL to be properly configured in all deployment environments.

## Related Documentation
- Updated devlog for dynamic social media previews feature
- NextAuth.js configuration documentation

## Lessons Learned
Environment variables should be consistently used across all URL generation points to avoid deployment environment issues.
