# 2025-07-10 22:23 - xAI Streaming Timeout Fix

## Issue Details
**Issue Title**: Resolve xAI streaming timeout issues
**Issue Description**: xAI reasoning models were experiencing timeout errors during streaming, causing token depletion and retry loops. The standard 5-second timeout was insufficient for xAI's reasoning models which require longer processing times.
**Dependencies**: AbstractAIProvider base class, xAI provider implementation
**Started**: 2025-07-10 19:00
**Completed**: 2025-07-10 22:23

## Summary
Implemented provider-specific timeout handling and graceful error recovery for xAI streaming to prevent timeout failures and token depletion.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `app/services/ai/providers/AbstractAIProvider.ts` - Added extended timeout support for xAI reasoning models and graceful timeout handling

### Architecture Decisions

### Design Choices
- Extended timeout to 30 seconds specifically for xAI reasoning models per xAI documentation recommendations
- Implemented graceful timeout handling that continues processing instead of throwing errors
- Used provider-specific timeout logic while maintaining backward compatibility

### Trade-offs
Longer timeouts increase wait time for users but prevent premature connection termination for reasoning models that require extended processing time.

### Patterns Used
- Provider-specific configuration pattern within the Template Method pattern
- Graceful degradation pattern for timeout handling

## Implementation Notes

### Key Algorithms/Logic
- Detection of xAI reasoning models using `this.name === 'xAI' && model.isReasoningModel`
- Extended timeout from 5s to 30s for xAI reasoning models
- Graceful fallback values: 'stop' for finishReason, null for usage data when timeouts occur
- Try-catch blocks around Promise.race() calls to handle timeouts without throwing

### External Dependencies
xAI API documentation recommendations for reasoning model timeouts

### Performance Considerations
- Prevents token depletion from failed retry loops
- Avoids unnecessary error throwing that could cascade to UI failures
- Maintains responsive UX by continuing processing even if metadata is delayed

## Testing Strategy
Manual testing with xAI reasoning models to verify streaming continues without timeout errors and graceful handling of delayed finishReason/usage data.

## Known Issues/Future Work
None identified - this resolves the xAI streaming reliability issues.

## Integration Points
- AbstractAIProvider template method pattern
- xAI provider implementation
- Streaming possibilities architecture
- Circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance

## Deployment/Configuration Changes
No configuration changes required - timeout handling is automatic based on provider and model type.

## Related Documentation
- xAI API documentation for reasoning model timeout recommendations
- AbstractAIProvider architecture documentation

## Lessons Learned
Provider-specific timeout requirements should be handled gracefully within the common interface while following external API documentation recommendations for optimal reliability.
