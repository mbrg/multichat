## Summary
Added comprehensive developer-focused footer to chat interface with privacy clarification, creator attribution, and open source repository link.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `app/components/chat/MessageInputContainer.tsx` - Added developer footer with privacy notice, creator attribution, and OSS links
- `app/components/chat/__tests__/MessageInputContainer.test.tsx` - Updated tests to match new component structure

### Architecture Decisions

### Design Choices
- Added privacy clarification with eye-off icon to build trust with security-conscious users
- Included creator attribution linking to professional site (mbgsec.com)
- Added GitHub repository link to emphasize open source nature
- Implemented consistent hover styling for all footer links
- Targeted messaging for hacking/developer community

### Trade-offs
Footer adds UI elements but provides valuable transparency and trust indicators for developer users.

### Patterns Used
Footer component pattern with consistent link styling and accessibility considerations.

## Implementation Notes

### Key Algorithms/Logic
- Privacy notice: "Conversations are not stored (unless shared)" with eye-off icon
- Creator attribution with external link to mbgsec.com
- OSS indicator with direct GitHub repository link (mbrg/multichat)
- Consistent hover states and styling for all interactive elements

### External Dependencies
- Icon library for eye-off icon
- External links to mbgsec.com and GitHub

### Performance Considerations
Minimal impact - simple footer component with external links.

## Testing Strategy
Updated existing tests to accommodate new footer structure and verify component rendering.

## Known Issues/Future Work
Footer positioning and content may need adjustment based on user feedback (later addressed in PR #87).

## Integration Points
- MessageInputContainer component architecture
- Chat interface layout system
- Icon component system

## Deployment/Configuration Changes
None required - footer is automatically displayed in chat interface.

## Lessons Learned
Developer-focused features should emphasize transparency, privacy, and open source nature to build trust with technical users.
