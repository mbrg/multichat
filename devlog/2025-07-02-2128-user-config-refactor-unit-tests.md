## Summary
Refactored user configuration handling with improved architecture and added comprehensive unit test coverage for critical AI services.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `app/components/SystemInstructionsPanel.tsx` - Improved config handling patterns
- `app/constants/defaults.ts` - Updated default configuration values
- `app/hooks/useSimplePossibilities.ts` - Enhanced configuration integration
- `app/services/ai/ChatService.ts` - Refactored configuration handling architecture
- `app/services/ai/SimplePossibilitiesService.ts` - Improved config management patterns

### Tests Added/Modified
- `app/components/__tests__/SystemInstructionsPanel.test.tsx` - Added system instructions tests
- `app/services/ai/__tests__/ChatService.test.ts` - Comprehensive ChatService unit tests
- `app/services/ai/__tests__/SimplePossibilitiesService.test.ts` - Extensive SimplePossibilitiesService tests

## Architecture Decisions

### Design Choices
- Improved separation of concerns in configuration handling
- Enhanced service layer with better config injection patterns
- Standardized configuration flow throughout the application
- Added comprehensive test coverage for critical business logic

### Trade-offs
Increased code complexity for better maintainability and test coverage.

### Patterns Used
- Dependency Injection pattern for configuration handling
- Service Layer pattern with improved testability
- Configuration abstraction for flexible settings management

## Implementation Notes

### Key Algorithms/Logic
- Refactored ChatService with cleaner configuration handling
- Enhanced SimplePossibilitiesService with improved config management
- Better integration between hooks and services for configuration flow
- Standardized default configuration management

### External Dependencies
Testing frameworks for comprehensive unit test coverage
Configuration management utilities

### Performance Considerations
- Improved configuration caching and management
- Reduced redundant config processing
- Better memory usage through optimized config handling

## Testing Strategy
Added comprehensive unit test suites covering:
- ChatService functionality and configuration handling
- SimplePossibilitiesService logic and edge cases
- SystemInstructionsPanel component behavior
- Configuration flow and integration patterns

## Known Issues/Future Work
None identified - architecture improvements provide better foundation for future development.

## Integration Points
- Configuration management system
- AI service architecture
- React hooks and state management
- Component configuration patterns

## Deployment/Configuration Changes
None required - architectural improvements are backward compatible.
