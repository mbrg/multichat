## Summary
Created comprehensive model selection system with dedicated UI, cloud persistence, and integration throughout the chat generation pipeline.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `app/api/chat/completions/route.ts` - Added model selection support to API
- `app/components/ChatContainer.tsx` - Integrated model selection with chat functionality
- `app/components/Menu.tsx` - Added models panel integration
- `app/components/Settings.tsx` - Enhanced settings with model configuration
- `app/components/__tests__/Settings.test.tsx` - Updated settings tests
- `app/components/chat/ChatHeader.tsx` - Added model selection access
- `app/components/chat/ModalContainer.tsx` - Integrated modal for model settings
- `app/components/chat/__tests__/ModalContainer.test.tsx` - Updated modal tests
- `app/components/menu/MenuDropdown.tsx` - Enhanced dropdown with models
- `app/components/menu/MenuItems.tsx` - Added model selection menu items
- `app/services/ai/ChatService.ts` - Enhanced chat service with model filtering
- `app/services/ai/permutations.ts` - Updated permutations for selected models
- `app/types/api.ts` - Added model selection API types
- `app/types/settings.ts` - Added model settings type definitions
- `app/utils/cloudSettings.ts` - Extended cloud settings for model preferences

### Files Created
- `app/components/ModelsPanel.tsx` - Complete model selection UI component
- `app/components/models/ModelToggle.tsx` - Individual model toggle component
- `app/components/__tests__/ModelsPanel.test.tsx` - Comprehensive model panel tests

### Architecture Decisions

### Design Choices
- Created dedicated ModelsPanel component with individual model toggles
- Implemented cloud persistence for model selection preferences
- Used toggle-based interface for intuitive enable/disable functionality
- Integrated model filtering throughout the generation pipeline

### Trade-offs
Added UI complexity but provides essential user control over which models are used for generation.

### Patterns Used
- Component composition pattern for model toggles
- Settings persistence pattern for user preferences
- Filter pattern for model selection in generation

## Implementation Notes

### Key Algorithms/Logic
- ModelsPanel with individual ModelToggle components for each available model
- Cloud persistence of selected models using settings infrastructure
- Dynamic model filtering in ChatService and permutations
- Real-time UI updates with optimistic state management

### External Dependencies
- Cloud settings storage
- AI provider model configurations
- Toggle UI components

### Performance Considerations
- Model filtering reduces unnecessary API calls to disabled providers
- Settings cached to avoid repeated cloud fetches
- Efficient re-rendering through component optimization

## Testing Strategy
Comprehensive unit tests for ModelsPanel, ModelToggle components, and integration with settings system and chat functionality.

## Known Issues/Future Work
None identified - complete model selection functionality implemented.

## Integration Points
- Chat generation system
- AI provider configuration
- Settings persistence
- Menu navigation
- Cloud storage infrastructure
- API completions endpoint

## Deployment/Configuration Changes
None required - model selection automatically available with cloud persistence.

## Lessons Learned
Model selection requires deep integration throughout the generation pipeline, from UI toggles to API filtering, with cloud persistence ensuring user preferences persist across sessions.
