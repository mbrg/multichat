# 2025-07-01 19:54 - Redis Support for Cloud KV

## Issue Details
**Issue Title**: Add Redis support for cloud KV storage
**Issue Description**: Implement Redis as an alternative KV store option to provide production-grade storage flexibility and improve scalability beyond the existing cloud storage solution
**Dependencies**: KV store abstraction layer, environment configuration, Redis client
**Started**: 2025-07-01 17:00
**Completed**: 2025-07-01 19:54

## Summary
Added comprehensive Redis support as a cloud KV storage option with factory pattern implementation, environment-based configuration, and full test coverage.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `.env.local.example` - Added Redis configuration examples
- `.env.prod.example` - Added production Redis environment variables
- `app/services/kv/KVStoreFactory.ts` - Enhanced factory to support Redis store creation
- `app/services/kv/__tests__/KVStoreFactory.test.ts` - Updated factory tests for Redis support
- `app/services/kv/__tests__/integration.test.ts` - Enhanced integration tests for Redis
- `app/services/kv/index.ts` - Added Redis store to exports
- `package.json` - Added Redis dependency
- `vitest.config.ts` - Added Redis mock configuration

### Files Created
- `app/__mocks__/redis.ts` - Redis mock for testing
- `app/services/kv/RedisKVStore.ts` - Complete Redis KV store implementation

### Architecture Decisions

### Design Choices
- Extended existing KV store abstraction pattern to support Redis
- Used Factory pattern for dynamic store selection based on environment
- Implemented IKVStore interface for consistent API across storage backends
- Environment-based configuration for flexible deployment options

### Trade-offs
Added Redis dependency increases package size but provides production-grade storage performance and reliability.

### Patterns Used
- Factory Pattern: Dynamic KV store selection
- Strategy Pattern: Interchangeable storage backends
- Interface Segregation: Common IKVStore interface

## Implementation Notes

### Key Algorithms/Logic
- KVStoreFactory enhanced with Redis detection and instantiation logic
- RedisKVStore implementation with full IKVStore interface compliance
- Environment variable-based store selection (REDIS_URL vs KV_URL)
- Comprehensive error handling and connection management

### External Dependencies
- Redis client library for Node.js
- Redis server infrastructure for deployment

### Performance Considerations
- Redis provides superior performance for frequent read/write operations
- Maintains existing LocalKVStore for development/testing
- Factory pattern enables runtime store selection without performance overhead

## Testing Strategy
- Comprehensive unit tests for Redis KV store implementation
- Integration tests covering Redis connectivity and operations
- Mock Redis implementation for isolated testing
- Updated factory tests to verify Redis store creation

## Known Issues/Future Work
- Redis server infrastructure needs to be provisioned for production use
- Connection pooling could be added for high-load scenarios

## Integration Points
- KV store abstraction layer
- Environment configuration system
- API key storage system
- User settings persistence
- Test infrastructure and mocking

## Deployment/Configuration Changes
Requires Redis server deployment and REDIS_URL environment variable configuration for Redis usage.

## Lessons Learned
Factory pattern with interface abstraction enables seamless addition of new storage backends while maintaining backward compatibility and consistent API usage.
