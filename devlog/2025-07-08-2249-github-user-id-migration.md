# 2025-07-08 22:49 - GitHub User ID Migration

## Issue Details
**Issue Title**: Prefix GitHub user IDs with /github/ for multi-provider support
**Issue Description**: Implement user ID format migration from raw GitHub user IDs to prefixed format (/github/{id}) to enable future multi-provider authentication support while maintaining existing user data
**Dependencies**: NextAuth.js, KV storage system, data encryption/decryption
**Started**: 2025-07-08 20:00
**Completed**: 2025-07-08 22:49

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive user ID migration system to transition from raw GitHub user IDs to prefixed format with seamless data migration for settings and API keys.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `app/lib/auth.ts` - Updated user ID generation to use /github/ prefix and integrated migration service
- `app/services/migration/DirtyUserIdMigration.ts` - Complete migration service with encrypt/decrypt handling

### Files Created
- `MIGRATION_REMOVAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Documentation for removing migration code after rollout
- `app/services/migration/DirtyUserIdMigration.ts` - Migration service implementation

### Architecture Decisions

### Design Choices
- Implemented "dirty migration" approach that runs during authentication session callback
- Used decrypt/re-encrypt pattern to safely migrate encrypted KV store data
- Added comprehensive logging and error handling for migration tracking
- Created removal instructions for post-rollout cleanup

### Trade-offs
Dirty migration approach adds processing overhead during authentication but ensures seamless user experience without data loss or separate migration scripts.

### Patterns Used
- Migration Pattern: Systematic data format transformation
- Encryption Pattern: Decrypt-process-re-encrypt for secure data migration
- Authentication Integration Pattern: Migration during session callback

## Implementation Notes

### Key Algorithms/Logic
- User ID format change: raw GitHub ID â†’ `/github/{id}`
- Migration detection based on existing vs. new user ID format
- Decrypt existing user data, migrate to new format, re-encrypt with new user ID
- Handles both settings and API keys data migration
- Automatic migration during authentication flow

### External Dependencies
- NextAuth.js session management
- KV storage interface (Upstash Redis)
- Web Crypto API for encryption/decryption

### Performance Considerations
- Migration runs only once per user during authentication
- Uses existing encryption/decryption infrastructure
- Includes proper error handling to prevent authentication failures

## Testing Strategy
Manual testing with existing user accounts to verify seamless migration of settings and API keys without data loss.

## Known Issues/Future Work
- Migration code should be removed after successful rollout (instructions provided)
- Future authentication providers will automatically use prefixed format

## Integration Points
- NextAuth.js authentication system
- KV storage abstraction layer
- User settings management
- API key storage system
- Data encryption service

## Deployment/Configuration Changes
No configuration changes required - migration is automatic during user authentication.

- `MIGRATION_REMOVAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Post-rollout cleanup instructions
- NextAuth.js configuration documentation
- KV storage interface documentation

## Lessons Learned
Dirty migrations integrated into authentication flow provide seamless user experience but require careful error handling and should include clear removal instructions for post-rollout cleanup.
