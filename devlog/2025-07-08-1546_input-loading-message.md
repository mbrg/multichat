# 2025-07-08-1546 - Input Loading Message Implementation

## Issue Details
**Issue Title**: Input Field Loading Message During Initialization
**Issue Description**: The input field is disabled for a moment during UI load while settings and API keys are loading, causing confusion for users who see a disabled input with no explanation.
**Dependencies**: MessageInputContainer component, useSettings hook, useApiKeys hook
**Started**: 2025-07-08 15:41:00
**Completed**: 2025-07-08 15:44:00

## Summary
Implemented a loading message in the input field placeholder to provide clear feedback to users during the unavoidable initialization delay when settings and API keys are being loaded.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `app/components/chat/MessageInputContainer.tsx` - Updated placeholder logic to show "Loading..." during settings/API key loading
- `app/components/chat/__tests__/MessageInputContainer.test.tsx` - Updated 3 test cases to expect "Loading..." placeholder

### Files Created
None

### Tests Added/Modified
- `app/components/chat/__tests__/MessageInputContainer.test.tsx` - Updated tests for settingsLoading, apiKeysLoading, and combined loading states

## Architecture Decisions

### Design Choices
- **Simple Loading Message**: Used "Loading..." instead of more specific messages to keep the UI clean and avoid complexity
- **Placeholder-Based Solution**: Chose to modify the placeholder text rather than adding separate loading UI elements to maintain existing visual design
- **Minimal Change Approach**: Only modified the placeholder logic without changing the overall component structure

### Trade-offs
- **Simplicity vs Detail**: Chose generic "Loading..." over specific messages like "Loading settings..." to avoid UI complexity
- **Existing Tests**: Updated existing tests rather than adding new ones to maintain test coverage without over-engineering

### Patterns Used
- **Conditional Rendering**: Used existing placeholder logic pattern to handle loading states
- **State-Based UI**: Leveraged existing loading state management from hooks

## Implementation Notes

### Key Algorithms/Logic
The placeholder logic follows this priority order:
1. "Generating response..." (highest priority - active generation)
2. "Loading..." (settings or API keys loading)
3. "Select a possibility to continue..." (unselected possibilities)
4. "Type message..." (normal ready state)
5. "Sign in to start chatting..." (unauthenticated)
6. "Configure API keys in settings..." (no API keys)

### External Dependencies
None added - leveraged existing hooks and state management

### Performance Considerations
- No performance impact - only changed display logic
- Loading states are already tracked by existing hooks

## Testing Strategy
- Updated existing unit tests to validate new loading message behavior
- Maintained full test coverage for all placeholder states
- Verified tests pass for all loading combinations (settings, API keys, both)

## Known Issues/Future Work
- Could potentially add more specific loading messages in the future
- Could consider animated loading indicators instead of static text

## Integration Points
- Integrates with existing `useSettings` and `useApiKeys` hooks
- Works with existing `MessageInput` component interface
- Maintains compatibility with `ChatContainer` and `ChatDemo` components

## Deployment/Configuration Changes
None required - purely frontend UI change

## Related Documentation
- No documentation updates needed - internal UI improvement

## Lessons Learned
- The initialization delay is unavoidable due to async loading of settings and API keys
- Simple placeholder messages can effectively communicate loading states without UI complexity
- Existing test patterns made it easy to update validation for new behavior
